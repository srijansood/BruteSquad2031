ECE 2031 - Travelling Salesbot Problem

Problem Description - http://powersof2.gatech.edu/2031/Project/Fall2015ProjectDetails.pdf

Given a set of destination coordinates, how can the DE2Bot visit as many as possible within a limited time?


TO-DO:
- Add pre-processing algorithm -> Current approach is Nearest Neighbor
	
Note - To compile and run pre-processing code use Makefile
Rules: use _make_/_make run_ for running it normally, _make debug_ for resetting the ASM file and then running.
Use _make lab_ to perform a run, pack everything and push to git. Use the _COORD=filename.json_ to specify a json file it should use.
